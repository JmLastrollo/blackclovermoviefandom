              Black Clover’s movie “The Sword of the Wizard King” features a side story when Asta is supposed to be in exile after Dominante’s judgment. The movie features the previous Wizard Kings going against their ideals as they prepare to destroy the Clover Kingdom. 
          </p>
          <p>
              The key fights of the movie were Asta vs Conrad and Yuno vs Jester. Conrad Leto, the 27th Wizard King, possesses terrifying magic which is difficult to counterattack. On the other hand, Yuno frees the Squad Captains and pushes past his limits as he fights against Jester Garandros, the 16th Wizard King.
          </p>
          <p>
              When pushed into a corner, Conrad decides to use a forbidden spell to obliterate the entire kingdom. As Asta ponders over his next step, he receives the Wizard King’s sword from Julius Novachrono. Asta channels the power of Conrad’s spell into the sword, which he uses to destroy the powerful mage.
          </p>
          <p>
              On the other hand, Yuno uses Asta’s signature technique when all his attacks prove to be ineffective against Jester’s impenetrable barriers. Unlike Asta, Yuno is against someone who died decades ago. Therefore, Yuno and the Captains drain Jester of all his energy, which also helps in Asta’s battle.
          </p>
          <p>
              He Imperial Sword Elsdocia is a magic sword created by the First Wizard King, Lemiel Silvamillion Clover. As the most powerful weapon in the Clover Kingdom, it was passed down the line of Wizard Kings. It was sealed along with Conrad Leto, the 27th Wizard King.
          </p>
          <p>
              The sword has the ability to absorb, store, and release magical powers. This sword has the power to annihilate an entire country. It also includes a fragment of the souls and magic of previous Wizard Kings.
